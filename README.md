HID exploitation framework through arduino for Red Teamers

A framework for automating the script generation so BadUsbâ€™s, various types of Arduino's and clones can be used by Red Teamers in
the field at any time to serve payloads quickly through physical access.
The concept is fairly simple. There is an increasing collection of payloads both for Windows and Linux targets with some standard 
options available to be set for each payload. The user chooses what suits for its job, sets the values of the parameters and 
generates an .ino file, ready to be loaded to a compatible Arduino board, either through Arduino IDE or the command line.

#Windows


To execute:
```
./
```
